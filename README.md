# OSMPL
The main OSM Minecraft plugin, meant for Beta 1.7.3.

## What this Includes
This includes various utilities that the OSM minecraft server relies on.

### How OSMPL works
OSMPL contains various modules that give different functionality. The current modules include:
- Util
- DiscordLink
- Economy (still relies on Essentials)
- TrustFactor
- ModuleManager

These modules can be disabled in game by using the `/module` command, or can be disabled by default in the OSMPL config.
